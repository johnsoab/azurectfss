## Known issues:
1. Don't currently have a task to create the inbound NAT via loadbalancer.
2. No obvious way to enable winRM so we can manage Windows Base with Ansible
3. Created playbook to customize workstation (FF/Burp/Zap/etc)
 * Still needs a task to setup proxy
4. Haven't yet created playbook to include securityshepherd-ansible role (trivial)
